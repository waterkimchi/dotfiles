#: Color scheme (should be loaded first)
include themes/diff-mocha.conf

#: The pygments color scheme to use for syntax highlighting. See
#: pygments builtin styles <https://pygments.org/styles/> for a list
#: of schemes. Note that this **does not** change the colors used for
#: diffing, only the colors used for syntax highlighting. To change
#: the general colors use the settings below.

pygments_style github-dark

#: File extension aliases for syntax highlight. For example, to syntax
#: highlight file.xyz as file.abc use a setting of xyz:abc. Multiple
#: aliases must be separated by spaces.

# syntax_aliases pyj:py pyi:py recipe:py

#: The number of lines of context to show around each change.

num_context_lines 3

#: The diff command to use. Must contain the placeholder _CONTEXT_
#: which will be replaced by the number of lines of context. A few
#: special values are allowed: auto will automatically pick an
#: available diff implementation. builtin will use the anchored diff
#: algorithm from the Go standard library. git will use the git
#: command to do the diffing. diff will use the diff command to do the
#: diffing.

diff_cmd auto

#: The string to replace tabs with. Default is to use four spaces.

replace_tab_by \x20\x20\x20\x20

#: A glob pattern that is matched against only the filename of files
#: and directories. Matching files and directories are ignored when
#: scanning the filesystem to look for files to diff. Can be specified
#: multiple times to use multiple patterns. For example::

#:     ignore_name .git
#:     ignore_name *~
#:     ignore_name *.pyc

ignore_name .git
ignore_name *~

#: Quit

map q   quit
map esc quit

#: Scroll down

map j    scroll_by 1
map down scroll_by 1

#: Scroll up

map k  scroll_by -1
map up scroll_by -1

#: Scroll to top

map home scroll_to start

#: Scroll to bottom

map end scroll_to end

#: Scroll to next page

map page_down scroll_to next-page
map space     scroll_to next-page

#: Scroll to previous page

map page_up scroll_to prev-page

#: Scroll to next change

map ; scroll_to next-change

#: Scroll to previous change

map , scroll_to prev-change

#: Show all context

map a change_context all

#: Show default context

map = change_context default

#: Increase context

map + change_context 5

#: Decrease context

map - change_context -5

#: Search forward

map / start_search regex forward

#: Search backward

map ? start_search regex backward

#: Scroll to next search match

map n scroll_to next-match
map > scroll_to next-match

#: Scroll to previous search match

map shift+n scroll_to prev-match
map < scroll_to prev-match

#: Search forward (no regex)

map f start_search substring forward

#: Search backward (no regex)

map b start_search substring backward

#: Copy selection to clipboard

map y copy_to_clipboard

#: Copy selection to clipboard or exit if no selection is present

map ctrl+c copy_to_clipboard_or_exit
